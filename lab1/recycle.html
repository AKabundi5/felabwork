        <h3>Recycling</h3>
            <p>Recycling is the process of gathering used materials (mainly waste materials) and reprocessing them again in order to use them. During recycling the used materials are sorted & processed out so that they can be used again as ‘raw materials’ to manufacture new products.</p>
            
        <h3>Saving water</h3>
            <p>Water saving is crucial for our planet’s health. We can conserve water by fixing leaks, using water-efficient appliances, and taking shorter showers. Turning off taps when not in use also helps. Collecting rainwater for gardening is another smart way to save.</p>
            
        <h3>Reducing Plastic</h3>
            <p>We can reduce it by using less plastic. Instead of plastic bags, we can use reusable ones. We can also bring our water bottles instead of buying plastic ones. Recycling plastic is important too. We should make sure to recycle bottles, containers, and other plastic items.</p>
            
        <h3>Reuse</h3>
        <p>Recycling aluminum cans saves 95% of the energy needed to make new ones. Imagine powering a TV for three hours with the energy saved from recycling just one can! A single plastic bottle can take up to 450 years to decompose.</p>
